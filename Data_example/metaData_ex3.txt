Metadata for provided data sets
---------------------------------

General
------
Data is provided in a (N_x,Nveh*N_sim) matrix
 - Splitting this into (N_x,Nveh,N_sim) tensor seems suitable

class encoding: [0,1,2,3] = [truck,passive,normal,aggressive]
Lane encoding: [-1,0,1] = [right,center,left]

Data is provided in a minimal state representation
x = [x-position,y-position,x-velocity,steering angle,angular rate, acceleration, class,lane]

This dataset
--------------
N_episodes = XX 
dist_max = 500 (goal distance in simulation)
N_x  = 6  (Number of vehicle features)
Nveh = 6 (Number of vehicles in simulation)
dt_sim = 0.2 (Simulation time steps (sec))
dt_ctrl = 0.2 (Controler decision time steps (sec) )
